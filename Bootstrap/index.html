                <br><p text-align: center> My name is Amy, and I was born in San Francisco. My family is Chinese, and they immigrated here from China. 
                    I am bilingual where I speak English and Cantonese. My personal interests are reading and listening to music. I
                     like to listen to a variety from classical to pop. I have been playing the viola for around 4 years with a year
                      of private lessons. I previously played the violin for 2 years. My favorite genres of books that I tend to enjoy
                       are dystopian and thriller. My all time favorite book would be Legend by Marie Lu. It has a dystopian theme that
                        also incorporates a bit of romance and is packed with suspense. My favorite subject in school would be math because 
                        I like solving problems and ever since I was little. Math has always been a part of me mainly because my parents 
                        made me go into a math tutoring program for the majority of my life.  
                    Three keywords that my friends would describe me would be smart, calm, and mature. If I were to describe myself, I 
                    would say that I am a very hardworking and independent person. I am also very persistent, and it is something that makes
                     me proud of who I am. I would also describe myself as a perfectionist because I am very meticulous about my grades as well
                      as being organized. Aside from my brief description of my personality, I aspire to be an engineer or something involving
                       science  because I am interested in the field. I find science to be very fascinating because we continue to discover so
                        many things every day.  We are evolving our knowledge to develop a more advanced society.</p>
