<h1>"I Am" Poem</h1>
<p> I am hardworking and persistent<br>
    I wonder if I will be famous<br>
    I hear birds singing<br>
    I see cats flying<br>
    I want to be successful in life<br>
    I am hardworking and persistent<br><br>
    I pretend to be a fish swimming in the ocean<br>
    I feel the clouds in the sky<br>
    I touch the wings of a pegasus<br>
    I worry about the crimes in the world<br>
    I cry in sad movies<br>
    I am hardworking and persistent <br><br>
    I understand the hardships of others<br>
    I say something good will eventually happen<br>
    I dream a life in luxury<br>
    I try to to be myself<br>
    I hope that everyone lives in contentment<br>
    I am hardworking and persistent
